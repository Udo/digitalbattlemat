= The Digital Battle Mat

When doing Pen & Paper RPGs, you often illustrate the fighting scenes with minis
on a small map. There are many types of maps, some are made of paper, some are
painted; you can even have one of those fancy BattleMats from Chessex. These
were the inspiration for this project. Find yourself an old, small TFT and place
it on the table. Connect your laptop to it and use the Digital Battle Mat for 
the real Geekdom! Besides the coolness of this digital version of the good old
battle plan, this software also offers a nice feature: You can create a mat any
time, save it and open it again later. This enables you to prepare more 
sophisticated maps, e. g. for city streets, in advance and use them later in the
game without hassle and "let me just paint this street" breaks.

This project is by no way associated with Chessex, Chessex' "BattleMat" product,
or similar companies. Hence the space between the two words "Battle" and "Mat".
